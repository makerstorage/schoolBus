<p align="justify">Wiring has always been a pain for DIYers. You need to find a single pin from bundles of inputs outputs repeatedly while struggling with loose cables and potential harm to your hardware and to yourself from short circuits. Fortunately, this situation does not exist in the world of SchoolBus.</p> 

<font face ="Acme"><p align="justify">The most simple to use part of the SchoolBus is to connect the Boards with each other. All the connectors on all boards have the same pin out. So there is nothing to think about just connect them with each other.</p> </font>

<p align="justify">SchoolBus connectors both have the power and the data pins. The connected board can have not only the the power it needs but also the data that it understand and act accordingly. Connect the boards like below and start using it.</p>
