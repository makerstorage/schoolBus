<p align="justify">We come up with an idea of easy to use electronic building blocks for Makers. The main idea is to reach the end result as quick as possible. We want you to concentrate the problem that you will solve not the details like pin to pin connections, microcontroller addresses and bunch of wires which are always problem. We work hard to bring the necessary hardware with compatible software within a reasonable price. </p>
