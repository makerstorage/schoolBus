<p align="justify">SchoolBus consist of several connectable boards. Each one has its own functionality. We try to develop as helpful as possible boards for makers. If you have an idea for a new board please tell us about it.
We hope to develop new boards with the help of the people from SchoolBus community</p>

<font face ="Acme"> <p align="justify">All our hardware is open source. This means you can create your own 
derivate of our work. But remember that the derivate also must be shared the same way with the same license.</p></font>


Before deciding SchoolBus boards, we looked at the anatomy of a hardware project. And see that there are fundamental functions that you will need. These function groups mostly always needed for a real world application. These are stated below.

* Sensors
* Processing
* Communications
* User Interface
* Storage
* Power
* Physical

Every SchoolBus board will fit in a category or must offer a solution to one of these functions. We are planing to have more than one board under these categories soon.

As We stated before SchoolBus boards are physical electronic circuit boards with easy to use connectors. We choose I2C protocol as a communication standard for all of our boards. We will talk more on I2C protocol later. 


### Connectors:

As shown in the picture we have different version of connectors. (Not so different) These connectors not only supply energy to the board but also help them to exchange data. All connectors on all boards have the same pins. Here is the pin-out:
